Using FastAI/ pytorch to create a CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) to predict whether an X-ray or CT Image is COVID-19 positive or negative (binary output).

Please see the comments in the ipython notebook.

Note: The metadata file was altered directly to put heavier weight on the covid negative images. Tactics can include merging datasets, putting more weight to certain images, duplicating certain images.
